  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p> In October 2014, the company NetCraft reached an extraordinary milestone
during their web server survey where they ocially conrmed that there
were over one billion websites on the world wide web (Internet Live Stats,
2016), which continues to increase daily and is being updated in real-time.
There are millions of websites based around the same theme or idea for
example sports, gaming, media etc. Which means that developers have to
design the websites carefully to ensure uniqueness and functionality for it to
be deemed successful. According to a research paper about the
characteristics to produce a good website, some of the following concepts
were identied; visual design, readability, content, personalization and
responsiveness (Al-Salebi, 2010). This can also be supported by another
article that states appearance, content functionality, usability are some of
the key elements of an eective website (Spirtz Web Solutions, 2012). After
taking all this into consideration it is important to question how successful
regularly used websites are. This essay will analyse three chosen websites
by comparing them in relation to the technology used in each and how
successful they are in portraying their message or achieving their primary
purpose.

<h1> Microsoft </h1>
<h3> Introduction</h3>
<p> The First website for analysis is going to be Microsoft. According to a
recent article Microsoft is amongst the top ten for the largest technology
companies in the world having a revenue of $86.5 billion (Sharf, 2016).
With over a billion users running or utilising Microsoft products, this is a
clear indication to the necessity of a successful and well developed website,
which will be accessed daily from numerous users.</p>

<h3>Inspection + Technologies Used</h3>

<p>From an overall look of the inspection without actually focussing too much
on the code it is obvious that the website has been constructed with
HTML5. HTML5 was ocially standardised and recommended in 2014,
which was approximately fourteen years after the recommendation of
XHTML 1.0 in the year 2000 (Shannon, 2012). The document type
denition <!DOCTYPE html> clearly identies the HTML5 usage, which
is an instruction to the browser informing it about the version of HTML
being used for the website. Furthermore, the xmlns specied below the type
denition contains a specication for an xml document.

<p> Another technology that could also be easily identied alongside the
HTML5 is JavaScript. JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and
had the purpose of providing behaviour to static webpages. In other words
it allows pages to be dynamic so for example allowing users to interact
more with the webpage through aspects such as pop-ups or text validation
(Machajewski, 2016). JavaScript les can be highlighted by the .js
extension.</p>

<p>The nal standout technology is CSS. Cascading Style Sheets are simply
used to organise the layout of a website this could include various dierent
characteristics such as font, colours, sizes etc. CSS was rst released in
1996 however it needed amendments which saw it republished in 1999
(Hissom, 2011). The current and latest standard is CSS3, these les can be
recognised with the .css extension.</p>

<p>Diverting attention onto the code in-depth and in specific, the sources
Microsoft have used for their website, the JavaScript library called jQuery
and a web development technique called Ajax come into the frame. Ajax is
based around the idea of loading data asynchronously without actually
reloading the whole page. The advantages of this are that response time is
faster which improves performance and speed, alongside this it also reduces
traffic between client and server (Baldota, 2011). On the other hand, the
JQuery library makes it easier to use JavaScript, the motto \write less, do
more" clearly highlights the purpose of the library (W3Schools, 2016). The
actual script file code itself is quite complex to read and to understand
however utilising the JavaScript beautifer tool, it becomes clearer as to
what the file does. Figure 2 (below), shows characters that are part of a
somewhat switch statement, which is possibly being used for validation
purposes.</p>

<p>Inspecting the page elements and source code there is no clear sign of any
technical issues or faults in the code. The breakpoints are also being
utilised successfully and the website has a responsive layout, for example it
can be resized as required. One of the more noticeable things about the
homepage is the slideshow of products changing every ve seconds. After
conducting research this is being facilitated by Akamai. The images being
displayed are pointing to Akamai servers. Akamai are a global content
delivery network found in 1998, who attempt to provide a fast, reliable and
secure service (Akamai, 2016).</p>

<h3>How successful is the website for its primary purpose?</h3>

<p>The primary purpose for this website is made apparent by looking at the
homepage. The navigation bar clearly demonstrates that Microsoft are
attempting to advertise their products and support their users. In relation
to the visual aspect of the page, the content relies solely on images with one
slideshow, which is surprisingly all that is needed to make the website
attractive. Alongside this the website is responsive and really well
structured so the user could easily nd what they are looking for. The
JavaScript used for the navigation bar, presents a reliable and fast selection
list when a button is clicked. The Microsoft website on the whole is an
excellent, well developed website, but this is expected from such a
dominant technology company.</p>

<h3>Issues Identified</h3>
<p>The only noticeable issues for any average website inspector would be that
the code is quite complex and hard to follow. Due to the fact that there are
dierent libraries and techniques being used for dierent parts of the
website it is quite hard to gure out what relates to what. In regards to
HTML, although there is a lot of information on the source page, it is
possible to gure out parts of the website through string values. There were
no console issues found.</p>
